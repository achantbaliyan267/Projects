        THE PGDM PROGRAMS
      </h2>
                    <p>IMT Hyderabad offers two-year full-time postgraduate programs called Post Graduate Diploma in
                            Management,
                            Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Finance) and Post Graduate Diploma in Management
                            (Marketing),
                            and a 15-month Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Executive) program. Students have the
                            option of
                            specializing in any one or two of the following streams: Marketing, Finance & Accounting,
                            Human Resource
                            Management, Operations Management and Business Analytics & Information Technology.<br><br>
                            The first year comprises of three terms (trimesters) and offers core courses compulsory for
                            all students.
                            In the second year, also comprising of three terms, students can choose electives from their
                            preferred area of specialization(s).
                            Exchange students usually prefer to enroll in the second year of the PGDM programs.</p>

        COURSE LOAD
      </h2>
                    <p>The second year of the PGDM programs is the most suitable for exchange students. During the
                            second year, students are required to choose 12 elective courses amounting to 36 credits.
                            Apart from these 12 courses, there is one compulsory course per term. The course in Term IV
                            is a core course on business ethics common to all students. The courses to be taken in Terms
                            V and VI are called Integrative Electives. These courses help students integrate different
                            functional areas and view the business as a holistic activity.
                            1 credit is equal to 10 hours of teaching. Thus, a 3-credit course comprises of 30 hours of
                            teaching (24 classroom sessions of 75 minutes’ duration).

  <p>
    IMT Hyderabad believes in the continuous assessment approach, where students are evaluated
    through the duration of the term with feedback provided periodically. Hence a student will
    be in a position to assess their relative performance and take measures for improvement at
    various points in the duration of the course(s).<br>
    The components of assessment and relative weightage for each component are decided by the
    course instructor(s). The weights assigned to the different components for overall
    evaluation are as follows:

    <p><strong>Class participation:</strong> Classroom-based courses will be delivered through discussion mode. Case discussions are an important pedagogic tool in almost all the classroom based courses. To participate in the discussion in the class, students need to prepare well. The ‘class participation’ assessment component will measure the ability of a student to understand the subject and communicate it effectively by participating in classroom discussions.</p>

    <p><strong>Written assignments:</strong> This includes a broad range of assessments such as essays, set of open ended questions, situation analysis, and review of literature. Broadly, the students’ work is assessed in terms of presentation, content, and critical judgment. The precise criteria for assessment within each of the assignments will vary according to the nature of the work being assessed.</p>

    <p><strong>Group project:</strong> Group projects are aimed at collaborative learning of the subject while developing team work skills. A group typically comprises of 4-5 members. Projects are designed in such a way that every member of the group has well defined responsibilities and all group members collectively have the responsibility to compile, consolidate and present their work as one single project.</p>

    <p><strong>Tests / Quizzes:</strong> One or two tests / quizzes will be conducted during the course for assessing subject knowledge.</p>
