                                                <p>As a PGDM-IT student, I had the privilege of participating in the student exchange program at NEOMA Business School, France. This experience was truly transformative—both academically and personally. Immersing
                                                    myself in a new education system broadened my outlook and introduced me to a learning environment that encouraged critical thinking, collaboration, and cultural exchange. During my time in Europe, I
                                                    had the opportunity to travel across 17 countries. Each journey enriched my understanding of diverse cultures, traditions, and ways of life. From engaging with peers from across the globe to navigating
                                                    new environments independently, every experience contributed to my personal growth and global awareness. This exchange program has been one of the most enriching chapters of my academic journey. It helped
                                                    me build confidence, adaptability, and a deeper appreciation for diversity. I am sincerely grateful to my college for providing this platform and for supporting students in exploring the world beyond

                                                <p>I remember the day the student exchange form was released. Without much deliberation, I filled it out. Looking back, that decision turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my academic journey.
                                                    Studying at <b>NEOMA Business School in Reims, France,</b> was much more than an academic experience. It gave me the chance to live and learn in an environment I had always hoped to be part of. The faculty
                                                    at NEOMA brought in real-world insights from across European markets. As a marketing student, I was introduced to brand storytelling in Europe, and I began to view marketing not just as a discipline
                                                    but as something deeply rooted in culture and everyday life. I had the opportunity to travel across 17 countries, and it reminded me how fulfilling it can be to step out of one’s comfort zone and explore
                                                    the world firsthand. Since returning, I find myself changed, not just as a student, but as a person. My worldview has expanded, my approach to problem-solving is more creative, and I am more confident
                                                    in navigating unfamiliar situations. I am truly grateful to IMT Hyderabad, Professor Nitin Gupta, and our senior Keerthivasan V for their constant support. If there’s one lasting takeaway, it’s that
                                                    living in a new culture doesn’t just teach you about the world; you become a new version of yourself.</p>

                                                    dream became a reality. It unlocked the door to a life-changing experience: an exchange program at NEOMA Business School in France. This wasn’t just about textbooks and lectures; it was a passport to
                                                    a world brimming with diverse cultures. Stepping onto the grounds of NEOMA was a dream come true. But the most profound lessons weren’t confined to just classrooms. Living in France and venturing across
                                                    10 other countries exposed me to a kaleidoscope of customs, traditions, and perspectives. From bustling pizzas in Rome to serene alpine villages in Interlaken, the transition offers a diverse range of

                                                    School of Business was exceptional. The academic rigour and a global perspective challenged me to think critically and creatively. The professors, their expertise and the diverse student body made every
                                                    class an enriching experience. This exchange programme enhanced my academic and cultural understanding and allowed me to grow personally. I learned to adapt to new environments, communicate effectively
                                                    across cultures, and embrace diversity with an open mind. These skills will undoubtedly benefit me in my further studies and future career. I am immensely grateful to IMT Hyderabad for this incredible
                                                    opportunity. The experiences I gained during my exchange program has been invaluable. I am eager to apply what I have learned to my PGDM journey at IMT.</p>

                                                <p>Stepping Out, Stepping Up, My Unforgettable Exchange Adventure. Participating in the student exchange program was an enriching and transformative experience that exceeded all my expectations. Not only did
                                                    I have the opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture and educational system, but I also forged lifelong friendships with peers from around the globe. From the moment I arrived in [La Rochelle],
                                                    my host family and fellow students greeted me with warmth and hospitality. The cultural exchange went beyond the classroom, as I had the chance to explore new traditions, cuisines, and ways of life.
                                                    It was incredible to witness firsthand how diverse perspectives and backgrounds can enrich our understanding of the world. One of the highlights of my exchange experience was the opportunity to travel
                                                    to neighbouring countries during breaks and weekends. Whether it was exploring historic landmarks, indulging in local delicacies, or simply soaking in the beauty of new landscapes, each excursion was
                                                    filled with unforgettable moments. But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of my exchange journey was the friendships I cultivated along the way. Despite coming from different corners of the world, we
                                                    bonded over shared interests, laughed together. Overall, my student exchange experience was a perfect blend of academic growth, cultural immersion, and personal enrichment. It not only broadened my horizons
                                                    but also instilled in me a deeper appreciation for diversity and the interconnectedness of our global community. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such an extraordinary
                                                    journey and will cherish the memories and friendships I made for a lifetime.</p>

                                                <p>I applied for the student exchange program because I believe it presents a unique opportunity to enhance educational and personal growth. This exchange program offers the chance to broaden horizons by immersing
                                                    oneself in a different academic and cultural environment. My learning in SEP is all about planning prior and keeping all the necessary things ready before starting any process. We got our visa at the
                                                    end of the day, which created a lot of tension and an uncertainty. We had to cancel our flight tickets and rebook later. After all the struggles, we celebrated our new year in Paris near Eiffel tower
                                                    which is one of the best experiences I had. Sticking together saved us lot of work and money during our SEP. We got a wonderful opportunity to visit other nearby countries, that is once in a lifetime
                                                    opportunity for anyone. I experienced the green and snowy areas of Swiss, Rome colosseum, Venice gondola ride, missing of train in Italy, northern lights and crossing of Arctic Circle in Finland. When
                                                    it comes to academics, I learnt international negotiations. I learnt data mining using rapid miner. I, even pitched for two new business ideas during our entrepreneurship class, my business ideas and
                                                    ideology has grown up from national level to international level, Now I am able to understand the markets. I lost the fear of speaking and giving presentations. Overall, my SEP is blend of all academics,
                                                    travelling, cultural diversity and the most important thing: ‘coming out of the comfort zone’. And finally, during my SEP I did two masters, one is International Business management and the second is
                                                    Masters in Cooking. I really learnt how to cook many dishes during my SEP.</p>

                                                <p>IMT, Hyderabad, has given me the incredible opportunity to participate in a student exchange program to Neoma Business School, Reims, France. My stay was for 4 months (January, 2023 to April, 2023). The
                                                    moment I stepped off the plane in Paris, I was greeted by a sense of excitement and anticipation. Over the next few months, I embarked on a journey that would forever shape my perspective on culture,
                                                    language, and the world. Attending classes at a French university was both challenging and rewarding. The different approach to education and the diverse international student body exposed me to fresh
                                                    ideas and unique perspectives. The discussions in class, often spanning cultural differences and global issues, broadened my horizons and encouraged me to think critically. Exploring the different countries,
                                                    cities and countryside was also an adventure in itself. My time in France was more than just an exchange program; it was a transformative journey that enriched my academic, personal, and cultural perspectives

                                                <p>I went on a summer exchange program to Neoma Business School, Reims in the beautiful country of France. The experience is no less than a dream come true. Packing up and leaving for a duration of four months,
                                                    feelings of nervousness and anxiety clouding my mind, but in the end it was all worth it. It was something completely out of my comfort zone but as the famous saying goes – “Life begins at the end of
                                                    your comfort zone”, I took the risk and ventured towards something that I will remember for life. Neoma offered me a chance to develop, learn, and grow in a multicultural environment. Learning from the
                                                    excellent faculties who all come from different parts of the world has helped me a lot in understanding things from different perspectives. It has also helped me boost my confidence and enhance my personality
                                                    because standing in a room full of foreigners and giving presentations and proving your worth is no easy task. I also got a chance to travel to neighbouring countries and I got to learn that travelling
                                                    and business have one thing in common, that is sometimes things may not go as per your plan and you need to think on your feet and take quick decisions to move forward, and it aided to help improve my
                                                    decision making skills.. All the knowledge and experiences have helped me grow and develop traits that will definitely prove beneficial to me in both my personal and professional life. Lastly, this dream
                                                    would not have come true without all the support from my parents and my institute IMT Hyderabad. I will be always grateful to IMT for providing me with this golden opportunity.</p>

                                                <p>"Travelling to a new place is always full of adventure and new experiences. When I got the opportunity to go to Canada and study, I knew a lot is coming my way, knowledge, experience, fear, courage, new
                                                    people, new friends, different cultures and what not. I was thrilled, I was happy and I was living it. And if the climate is your personal favorite, it adds to your glee. Montreal was submerged in snow
                                                    for two months and I loved it. Being in a country extremely different from your home calls for a greater involvement. From taking the public transport to coming back home was itself a unique experience
                                                    in life. I explored the city, got overwhelmed by the scenic beauty, learned new cultures, observed people, their habits, and their lifestyles. I got a bit nostalgic because time stops for no one. One
                                                    thing is there for sure and that is, Student Exchange Program is not a year in your life it is a life in a year. I am really thankful to IMT Hyderabad that I could take this endeavor and I can now cherish

                                                  I explored destinations like Rajasthan, Agra, Chennai, Goa, and Kerala, each showcasing India’s rich heritage. From Rajasthan’s majestic palaces to Kerala’s serene backwaters and the iconic Taj Mahal, the beauty was awe-inspiring. Adapting to spicy cuisine and extreme heat was challenging but offered valuable insights into local life.

Supportive professors and welcoming Indian students created an inclusive environment, enriching my understanding of cultural nuances and classroom dynamics.

It was more than just an academic exchange; it has been a true human and cultural adventure.

                                                  I had the chance to travel around India during my stay and explore cities like Goa and Kochi. These trips allowed me to discover breathtaking landscapes, from the calm beaches of South Goa to the verdant tea plantations of Munnar, where each place had a unique and enriching story to tell.
                                                                                      
                                                  At IMT, I met incredible people with whom I hope to maintain lifelong friendships. I will cherish these friendships, which were built around shared moments, laughter, and discoveries. Living on campus gave me a deep immersion in the lives of local students and Indian culture. The academic environment at IMT helped me develop my skills while opening up new perspectives of opportunities.

                                                  During my 4 months in India, I was able to discover different regions, all very different from each other, and met many people. I was particularly touched by their open-mindedness, their sense of welcome and their kindness towards us. In addition to my travels, my academic experience at IMT Hyderabad was also very enriching. The two other French students and I were really immersed in an Indian university, following the same courses as the students and taking part in the school's events. We really got out of our comfort zone, as we weren't used to knowing anyone around us. We were made very welcome by the students and we'll keep in touch with them!
                                                                                      
                                                  The courses were very similar to those we had at NEOMA and the teachers were very friendly and very attentive. However, the cultural difference is quite big compared to France, so we were really disorientated. What's more, there were only three of us, which complicated things. Nevertheless, it was an experience that will remain engraved in my memory!
